# Patterns of Text Readability in Human and Predicted Eye Movements

This repo contains the code for the experiments presented in the following paper:  
Nora Hollenstein, Itziar Gonzalez-Dios, Lisa Beinborn & Lena JÃ¤ger. "Patterns of Text Readability in Human and Predicted Eye Movements". _CogALex 2022_.

## Publication

## Training and evaluating models
The code in the following repository was used to fine-tune and test the models: https://github.com/DS3Lab/multilingual-gaze

## Readability analysis
The scripts in `readability-analysis` were used for the analysis in the paper.  
Run `correlations.py` to get the correlation coefficients between predicted eye tracking features and the readability measures.
